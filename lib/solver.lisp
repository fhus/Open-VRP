When defining your own algorithms, make sure to implement a run-algo method for your algo, which sets the <algo> slots appropriately, and returns the <algo> object.

For search algorithms -- such as local search, population based algorithms -- may make use of the iterate method to automatically set the slots after each iteration."))
